# Helmo
A collection of template helpers to work with Helm.

The idea is to have a centralized place for helpers and templates that have been created following best practices, or ar least some logic, so they can be used later in specific Helm repositories.

Nowadays, all of these have been created by myself while learning Helm and ArgoCD at home, I published them to not repeat myself at work and be able to use them everywhere. Everyone is invited to use them and collaborate.
